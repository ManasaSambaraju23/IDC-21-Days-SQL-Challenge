# 🚀 21-Day SQL Challenge — My SQL Learning Journey

Welcome to my **21-Day SQL Challenge** repository! 🎯  
Here, I’m documenting my **daily SQL practice**, queries, and reflections as part of the challenge by **Indian Data Club**.  
Each day brings a new problem, a fresh concept, and a small step toward mastering real-world data analysis with SQL.
